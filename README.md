# CUNY BookShelf
<img src="/pictures/cunybookshelf.png" width="300">
*An [ionic](http://www.ionicframework.com/) project that was built during CUNY Hackathon*

## Problems
* [CUNY library website](http://www.cuny.edu/libraries.html) isn’t user friendly. 
* It doesn’t load properly on a phone browser.
* Students are limited to just books available in CUNY to search.

## Our Solution
* Search books across all CUNY libraries, public libraries AND users with accurate status of the books in one place
* Sell books on the apps as a seller, profitable
* Buy books from any available sellers including a reference to buy from Amazon

## Why Students Need It
* Mobile Application
  * Responsive Design 
  * Fluid UI
  * User-Friendly
* Simplicity
  * Search any book through Open Library API
  * Buying & Selling 
  * Barcode Scanner Functionality
